#Scriptname & version: Cardboy0's shapekey- and animation-compliant softbodies - V.1.1 
#Author: Cardboy0 (https://www.deviantart.com/cardboy0)
#Made for Blender 2.81a

######About this script:########
#   (for other versions and a more detailed explanation visit https://www.deviantart.com/cardboy0/art/Cardboy0-s-SACS-Script-for-Blender-827936331)
#The purpose of this script is to stop softbodies in Blender 2.81 from deforming without any collision by themselves, mainly when being animated. If you don't know what I mean,
#go into Blender, add a plane, scale it x2 in edit mode and subdivide it like 12 times (10 times and then 2 times again), then give it the following keyframed rotations: At frame 1 - X=90° Y=0° Z=0°, at frame 20 - X=270° Y=0° Z=45°. Then give it the softbody modifier, enable "goal" and "edges" (default values should be enough) in its properties and set its mass to 0kg (so it won't "wobble" because of gravity). 
#What you'd expect after baking is that nothing happens, because after all, there are no collision objects yet and the enabled goal should make it animate like the keyframes tell it to. What you'll see however, is that the plane gets deformed at some points, showing for instance some weird folding, maybe not to the extreme, but you can see it. The result is also a bit random, as you can bake it again and it will deform slightly different. So if you don't see it, bake it again. (For some reason that self-deforming-effect disappears if you already have a collision object in the scene, but it didn't disappear in my files with more complex meshes.)
#How I understand it now after dealing a little bit of time with it is that the goal and edges properties are in conflict with each other, both can deform the object. Somewhere in the official documentation it is written that they both influence the softbody, and you know, that makes sense. You want that, otherwise you could have no static objects slightly being deformed in midair or whatever.
#But the crucial part, which I think isn't mentioned enough in the documentation, is what the properties see as their goals. The "goal" property tries to animate it like its default animation, like the rotation of our plane or keyframed shapekeys, etc.
#The "edges" property however doesnt look at those animations. It tries to keep the softbody in its original shape, and thus fucks up the animation. If you animate with shapekeys, it will try to make the object go back to the shape of the Basis shapekey, if you're animating it in object mode it's probably the first keyframe of it. It sees any animations of those original shapes as exterior forces, and acts according to it.
#
#But in my case I didn't want that to happen, I wanted my softbody to keep its shape when being animated, but still be deformed by collision objects. So I made this script.
#It does what you originally expected the softbody properties to do, through shapekeys it will treat the shape of the object in frame x as the basis for that bake of frame x,
#meaning that the basis shapekeys will change to show the actual default animation, and thus not be deformed without collision. You don't have to worry if you're not using shapekeys,
#through the use of the 'NewTek MDD format' you can convert your animations into shapekeys that will play for each frame.
#Each frame will be baked individually, using the finished bake of the previous frame as the starting shape (as a shapekey), and the current shape of your object for that frame as the Basis shapekey.
#To create those Basis shapekeys you need to have 'Corrective Shape Keys' (mentioned again below) installed, it allows you to duplicate an object with shapekeys, removing all shapekeys and using the previous shapekey-mix as it's default shape now.
#Since only using one frame for baking each time appeared to not be enough to get decent results, I enabled this script to stretch your animation time. That way, it will have more frames between each original frame to bake them, slowing down the calculation but giving better results.
#Even if it bakes more than one frame, it will still only export the last baked frame through the .mdd format again and import that shape as a shapekey to another version of your original model without shapekeys, so in the end all the keyframed, individually imported shapekeys will together show the final, baked animation.
#It also stretches the time back to its default value afterwards.
#Since I had no prior experience in blender scripting, some operations where stolen from other people who found these to be solutions for certain problems I encountered, I left the links to those posts at the end of this script in the "reference"-paragraph.

#To see how the calculation is doing you should toggle the system console (in the window tab, Mac Users need to do it differently I think), after a frame has finished baking the script will say something like "Frame 34 done" since I wrote that somewhere in this script. That way you can be sure that the script is still working and your blender didnt just freeze.





### DRAWBACKS (at least the ones I know about):
# - Depending on your selected values the script will take a proportionally increased amount of time to finish compared to your original, "vanilla" softbody simulation. However it should only be a proportional correlation, meaning it might take 5, 10 or 15 times longer if you choose values like 5, 10 or 15, but not 5*1, 10*2, 15*3, or similar math stuff. It's still managable.
# - The script is only able to properly bake softbody sims that don't show any jiggle of the main animation mesh, or any other movent that's based on the use of velocity of vertices from the previous frames. Meaning you can bake for instance a collision-sphere colliding with a moving softbody-plane (making it dent), but if you try to let a softbody cube fall unto a collision plane, the cube will not show acceleration, meaning it falls with a constant velocity, and once it hits the plane it will likely only deform a tiny bit since there's almost no force from gravity, and it also won't jiggle in any way, because that requires the softbody sim to know the velocity of the vertices from previous frames, what this script prevents.
# - It might fuck up your scene, for instance it scales and later unscales all keyframes of all your objects, even unselected ones (it's not intended to do that, I just didn't find a different solution to that yet - although it also stretches your collision objects without you having to select them). So if something goes wrong, suddenly all your objects will have stretched keyframes. You should always make a backup of your blend file before you run this script.
# - The deformation it is intended to do might not work as well as you hoped it would, and you might have to increase some time-consuming values of this script to change that to the better, if it's possible at all. This script is far from perfect.
# - Your main animation mesh will show almost no self-induced deformation, but there'll still be some tiny amount of it that you might notice if you zoom in for instance. Basing on my understanding of the softbody system that shouldn't actually be the case, but apparentely I am wrong. Maybe it's fixable somehow.
# - You might notice that some vertices of your softbody will appear to "vibrate" when gliding against a collision object. Still need to find a fix for that.




### PLEASE READ: REQUIREMENTS

# - You need to have three Add-ons installed (they're already included in blender, you only have to enable them from the Add-ons tab in your preferences window):
#       "Animation: Corrective Shape Keys"
#       "Import-Export: NewTek MDD format"
#       "Interface: Copy Attributes Menu"

#       You only need to use the NewTek MDD format one yourself once, but the script needs all of them to work, since it uses some functions of those Add-ons.
# - Always backup your file before running this script, you don't want to get a nasty surprise.
# - Specify some values at the top of the script. The most important ones are your chosen framerange and the "time stretch multiplier". I mentioned stretching your keyframes, and that's the value by which they'll get stretched. Only use integers. Concerning the modifiers you can specify as well: Obviously your softbody-dummy needs the softbody-modifier, but you might want to add other modifiers that rely on the shape of an object at the current frame. "Corrective Smooth" is one example, you can't just add it at the end to the finished result, because that result only has one Basis shapekey, but for the modifier to properly work it needs a reference shape of each frame to know what actually is the original shape of that frame.
# - You need to make 2 duplicates of your softbody object, and keep the original as a backup. The first duplicate (call it something like "main animation object", although the name doesnt matter to the script) needs to be exported as an .mdd, have all its modifiers applied (for deforming modifiers it probably won't really matter wether they're deleted or applied, but ones that change the amount of vertices, like a subdivision surface modifier, need to be applied), have all its shapekeys and keyframes deleted and then the previously exported .mmd imported on that same object again. That object should then show the exact same animation as before, only that it's now animated entirely through keyframes of shapekeys, one for each frame. The second duplicate (called "softbody dummy" from here on) should have all the modifiers you want on your object (not all might work though),but of course especially a softbody modifier. The script will do many seperate softbody calculations on many seperate objects, and for each of those new objects it will use this duplicate to copy its softbody properties to those new objects. So, the softbody properties you give the softbody dummy are the ones this script will use. You could use a simple mesh with the same softbody properties as well, only that you then can't use vertex groups, for instance for the goal-property. 
# - You need to only have those 2 duplicates selected when running the script, and the "main animation" one has to be the active object.



############ Important user-dependent values #############

baking_start_f = 1     #the desired first frame of your animation
baking_end_f   = 250    #the desired last frame of your animation

time_stretch_multiplier = 6        #stretches the timing of keyframes by that value, meaning with a value of 3 a keyframe at frame 1 will now be at frame 3, a keyframe at frame 2 now at frame 6, and so forth. This effectively means that the softbody calculations have more frames to work with. If you don't want to stretch anything just set it to 1 (not recommended).

vis_modifiers = ["Softbody","CorrectiveSmooth"]   #Those are the modifiers of your softbody dummy you want to be applied for each frame, but not actually change the original bake for the next frame bake, basically meaning only visual modifiers. If you're not sure, put all your softbody-dummy modifiers into this list (their actual names - like wireframe.001 - in quotation marks, and seperated with commas). The softbody-modifier you can see in the list as well is an exception, it simply is listed here (and specifically at the first position) because in most cases it needs to be applied before all other visual modifiers. Not all modifiers might work.

console_input = False     #Maybe you want to define some values inside the console instead of changing them in this script everytime, if so, set this value to True. Of course that required you to have the Blender system console open; Windows-users can toggle it in "Window" -> "Toggle System Console". If you don't have it open your blender will freeze because it waits for an imput that you can't put in.

main_anim_copy = True     #when the baked results of this script are created, they won't have the original-animated frames of the unbaked timeframe on them, thus preventing you from using the script on them. This value creates a copy of your main-animation object, which also gets the last baked frame imported on it. This will allow you to continue the script at that frame using the new copy, as the first specified frame will be used without any baking involved, only as a reference for the next one.

desired_target_collection = "master_collection" #name of the collection you want to have the results in (they also get their own collections). 'master_collection' is the default and refers to the collection of your current scene that all other collections of that scene are linked to.

#That's the only values you have to set yourself, the rest from here on is just the actual script.

#small note: if your softbody seems to get stuck, or even sucked into your collision object (CO), try inverting the normals of the CO. It happened to me in one of my files for all collision objects (I have no idea how), but that fixed it.
